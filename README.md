A Store Inventory

Create a new virtual Python environment
Create a virtual environment in your project's directory by running the following command in your terminal:

python -m venv env
NOTE: The environment (./env) folder and files pertaining to your virtual environment should not be added to your GitHub repo.

Activate your new virtual Python environment
Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in your terminal for students using macs:

If using Mac/Linux:

source ./env/bin/activate
If using Windows:

.\env\Scripts\activate
Install required dependencies into your Python environment
Install the project requirements from the provided requirements.txt file by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Create your application file
Create a new file in your project directory called app.py. Be sure to import the appropriate Python and Peewee modules at the top of this file.

Initialize your Sqlite database
Initialize a Sqlite database called inventory.db.

Create your Product model
Create a model called Product that the Peewee ORM will use to build the database. The Product model should have five attributes: product_id, product_name, product_quantity, product_price, and date_updated. Use PeeWee's built in primary_key functionality for the product_id field, so that each product will have an automatically generated unique identifier.

Connect the database and create tables
In your dunder main method:

Ensure you are connected to the database you created/initialized
Ensure you load the CSV products data into the created table
Run the application so the user can make menu choices and interact with the application.
Read in the existing CSV data
Read the inventory.csv file into your program, and create a list that contains each product inside the csv file as a dictionary. Be sure to clean up the data before adding each product dictionary to your list:

the value for product_id will be stored as PeeWee's built in primary_key
the value for product_quantity will be stored as an integer
the value for product_price will be stored as an integer and converted to cents ($3.19 becomes 319, for example)
the value for date_updated will be stored as a datetime.
Hint: You'll need the datetime module for this.
Add the data from CSV into the database
Create a function that will add the products listed in the inventory.csv file to the database.

Create a Menu to make selections
Create a function to handle interaction with the user of your app. This function should prompt the user to enter v in order to view the details of a single product in the database, a to add a new product to the database, or b to make a backup of the entire contents of the database.

Displaying a product by its ID - Menu Option V
Create a function to handle getting and displaying a product by its product_id.

Adding a new product to the database - Menu Option A
Create a function to handle adding a new product to the database. This function should prompt the user to enter the product's name, quantity, and price. The function must process the user provided value for price from a string to an int. Be sure the value you stored for the price field to the database is converted to cents ($2.99 becomes 299, for example).

Backup the database (Export new CSV) - Menu Option B
Create a function to handle making a backup of the database. The backup should be written to a .csv file.

Extra Credit
To get an "exceeds" rating, complete all of the steps below:

 5 steps
Avoiding duplicate products
When adding product data into the database, add an additional check before that product is added so that if a duplicate product name is found, the app will save the data that was most recently updated for that existing record.

Menu validation
When entering input for the menu selection feature, add extra validation that ensures if the User enters any other character besides v, a, or b it will notify them of their error and re-prompts them again for their menu input.

Menu option: v
When selecting option v, If the User enters a product ID that does not exist, a human readable error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to try again.

Menu option: a
When selecting option a, if a duplicate product name is found while the product is attempting to be added to the database, the app will check to see which product entry was most recently updated and only save that data.

Menu option: b
When selecting option b, the backup CSV output file should contain a single header row with all the appropriate field titles

NOTE: Getting an "Exceed Expectations" grade.

See the rubric in the "How You'll Be Graded" tab above for details on what you need to receive an "Exceed Expectations" grade.
Passing grades are final. If you try for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade, but miss an item and receive a “Meets Expectations” grade, you won’t get a second chance. Exceptions can be made for items that have been misgraded in review.
Always mention in the comments of your submission or any resubmission, what grade you are going for. Some students want their project to be rejected if they do not meet all Exceeds Expectations Requirements, others will try for all the "exceeds" requirement but do not mind if they pass with a Meets Expectations grade. Leaving a comment in your submission will help the reviewer understand which grade you are specifically going for
